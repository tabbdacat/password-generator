# Password Generator Application

## Description

This application was developed to generate a randomized password which can be customized to include multiple characters as specified and customized to a certain character length as directed. Once you click the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts will generate. After the prompts are answered with the criteria you wish to include in your password, a password will display in the text box.

The application is made to be easy to use and interactive, with box sizes and display adjustable to screen size. JavaScript best practices for file structure and naming conventions were followed. 

While developing this website, I learned about the basics of what JavaScript is capable of doing to make a website more interactive and functional for users. I am excited to learn more about how I can apply JavaScript to future projects.

## Usage

Once viewing the website, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can view the Sources tab to view how Javascript functions were used to generate this application . The script.js file is organized to be efficient and easy to read, including comments regarding how each line is structured to generate a randomized password.
